<h1> Opensource Foodie </h1>

Have a restaurant that blew your socks off and now you can't stop talking about it to the chagrin of your friends and family members? Please file an issue with your suggestions and I'll vet it (hey - I know the internet) and then share it and try it next time I'm your neck of the woods!
